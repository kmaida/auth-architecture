# Backend-for-Frontend: Frontend

1. In your filesystem, open a console in the `auth-architecture/bff/frontend` folder
2. Remove the `.sample` suffix from `.env.sample` (no changes are needed to this sample file)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev` to run the development environment using [Vite](https://vite.dev), accessible in the browser at `http://localhost:5173`

If you have the backend server and FusionAuth container running, you should be able to log into the frontend app with the admin credentials provided in the FusionAuth installation section.

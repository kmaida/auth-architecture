# Browser-based OAuth 2.0 Client: Frontend

1. In your filesystem, open a console in the `auth-architecture/bboc/frontend` folder
2. Remove the `.sample` suffix from `.env.sample` and make necessary changes
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev` to run the development environment using [Vite](https://vite.dev), accessible in the browser at `http://localhost:5173`

If you have the FusionAuth container running, you should be able to log into the frontend app with the admin credentials provided in the FusionAuth installation section.
